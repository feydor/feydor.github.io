## About Me

Hello there! I'm Victor, a software developer. My background is in computer engineering which I studied at the [Univertsity of Arizona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Arizona). I live in [Tucson, Arizona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucson,_Arizona) and my interests mainly center around computer programming, philosophy, retro hardware, and anime.

I maintain this site in order to showcase my work and share things that are meaningful to me. For the details of my work continue below, or use the sidebar.

## Recent Projects

### imp
An image processing utility for basic graphics processing and optimization benchmarking. This program currently provides [ordered dithering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_dithering), palette interpolation, the sum of absolute differences, etc on user-provided images. It is handwritten in standard [C11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C11_(C_standard_revision)) with certain algorithms written in [x86-64](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/introduction-to-x64-assembly.html) assembly language.

The source code is publicly available [here](https://github.com/feydor/imp).

### libsaru
A <abbr title="work-in-progress">wip</abbr> library that aims to collect useful data structures I've previously implemented. Each data structure and its methods are thoroughly tested using the [Unity](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity) testing framework. It is handwritten in standard C11.

The source code is publicly available [here](https://github.com/feydor/saru-buf)

### 2hu-demo
A game engine/demo based on Zun's [Touhou Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project)(東方プロジェクト) series of danmaku shoot'em ups. So far I've implemented collision detection, shot progression, item/bomb drops, rudimentary scoring. The program is written in standard C11 with graphics done using the [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) API.

The source code is publicly available [here](https://github.com/feydor/2hu-demo).

### [Conway's Game of Life WebGL](https://3dlife.netlify.app/)
A [TypeScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript) implementation of Conway's Game of Life. The program supports switching between a 2D and 3D perspective as well as multiple fun color options and configurations. It was handwritten in a mixture of TypeScript (for the main algorithm) and JavaScript (for the UI).

A live version is available [here](https://3dlife.netlify.app/).  
The source code is publicly available [here](https://github.com/feydor/game-of-life).

### [purl-shortener](https://p-url.herokuapp.com/)
A web application that provides collision-free <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> hashing to shorten links for sharing. The program supports saving and restoring <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> links for up to 24 hours without an account. It is written in plain JavaScript with MongoDB as the database and Bootstrap/CSS for the styling.

A live version is available [here](https://p-url.herokuapp.com/).  
The source code is publicly available [here](https://github.com/feydor/purl-shortener).                

## Languages and Technologies
I'm most familiar working in C and JavaScript. I'm also comfortable with C++, SQL, and the <abbr title="MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS">MERN</abbr> stack.  
Nearly all of my projects are worked on in the Linux shell using: Git version control, VSCode or neovim, and the Meson build system.
